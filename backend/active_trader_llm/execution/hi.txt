CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT
Let me analyze the current situation systematically:

Current Account State:

Available Cash: $5,137.93
Account Value: $9,047.09
Total Return: -9.53%
Two open positions: ETH and SOL
Existing Positions Analysis:

ETH Position:

Long 3.65 ETH @ 3807.65
Current: 3873.85 (+1.74%)
Unrealized PnL: $241.63
Leverage: 10x
Stop: 3675.5, Target: 3950.0
Risk: $490
Confidence: 0.65
Current RSI(7): 66.39 (strong momentum)
Price above EMA20 (3873.85 vs 3873.19)
MACD turning positive (0.04)
Invalidation: Price below 3650 or RSI(7) < 8
Analysis: ETH is showing good momentum. RSI(7) at 66.39 is healthy. Price is consolidating around EMA20. No reason to close - invalidation hasn't triggered. HOLD.

SOL Position:

Long 237.88 SOL @ 185.44
Current: 185.775 (+0.18%)
Unrealized PnL: $79.93
Leverage: 20x
Stop: 180.84, Target: 189.5
Risk: $1,103.20
Confidence: 0.75
Current RSI(7): 68.74 (strong momentum)
Price above EMA20 (185.775 vs 185.718)
MACD improving (-0.14 but trending better)
Invalidation: RSI(7) < 5 or close below 183
Analysis: SOL showing strong momentum with RSI(7) at 68.74. Price consolidating near EMA20. No invalidation triggered. HOLD.

New Opportunity Analysis:

I'm seeing potential in BTC's current setup. The price just crossed above the EMA20 at 110,015.85, with RSI(7) climbing to 60.53 and showing signs of recovery from oversold conditions. The MACD is also improving, suggesting a possible bullish trend emerging.

However, the 4-hour chart reveals BTC remains below key moving averages, indicating continued downward pressure. Open interest appears stable with neutral funding, making this an unattractive entry at the moment.

BNB looks equally uncompelling. Trading right at its EMA20 with a neutral RSI and slightly positive MACD, the coin lacks clear directional momentum. The 4-hour chart confirms a downtrend, reinforcing my decision to pass.

SOL and ETH remain in current positions. Waiting for clearer signals.

XRP shows intriguing price action. Trading just above its EMA20 with an extremely high RSI of 75.54, the momentum looks powerful but potentially overextended. The 4-hour chart remains below key EMAs, suggesting caution. Despite the strong RSI, the risk of an imminent pullback is significant.

DOGE presents a flat scenario. Price hovering around its EMA20, RSI showing modest improvement, but 4-hour chart still below critical moving averages. No compelling trade setup emerges.

Current strategy maintains existing positions. ETH and SOL remain on hold without invalidation signals. No new entry points present themselves in the current market conditions.

Preparing JSON documentation for existing holdings with hold status will be the next step.
